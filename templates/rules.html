        <h1>Rules to Don't Say Pineapple</h1>
        <p>
            This game is played with a group of friends. Each player in the group gets a random word and a target. 
            The goal is to get your target to say the word. If they say it, they are dead and your new target is their old target.
            If your target says a homonym or any form of the word, that counts – they are dead.
            There are two titles to win: 'be the last one alive' and 'have the most kills'. 
        </p>
        <h4>How to use the website</h4>
        <p>
            Everyone in the group must have an account. 
            One player (the host) creates a game and the rest join through the code.
            The host has the option to choose the word difficulty and the method of passing on words.
            Once everyone has joined, the host can start the game.
            You are given your word and target.
            If you are killed, you must press the "I was killed button".
            The host has the power to purge any player for whatever reason (like inctivity).
            When only one person remains, the game ends. 
            The last person alive and the person with the most kills get the winner titles.
            If your target was purged, you do not get the kill.
