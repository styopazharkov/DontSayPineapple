## Features Description
 The website works as a shuffler for the game. It hands out words and targets for the players. The game settings allow for various word difficulties and pass-on methods. The host of the game can kick players before the game has started or purge them after the game has started (for reasons such as inactivity or misbehavior). Each player can choose one of the theme for the aesthetics of their account and a status for everyone to see. Each past game is stored and can be accessed by anyone to see the results (with a provided kill log).

## Account Security
A complete login system is implemented. Passwords are securely stored hashed with salt. Each page except the index and rules page can only be accessed if the user is logged in. The password and username are stored locally through session variables.
